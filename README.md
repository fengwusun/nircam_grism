JWST NIRCam/WFSS Grism codes and data produced by Fengwu Sun et al.

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact me via my email: fengwusun[åœ¨]arizona.edu

If you find my workflow, codes and/or data products helpful, it would be great if you could acknowledge it in your research. I am working on a document of NIRCam/WFSS which should be part of my PhD thesis, but if you cannot wait to cite my thesis until May/June 2023, maybe you can cite our latest grism paper at: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220903374S/abstract
